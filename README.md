# Canvas FX (Foundry VTT)

**Canvas FX** is a lightweight module for Foundry VTT (v12/v13) that allows Game Masters to trigger screen-space visual effects, such as raining emojis, text overlays, screen shakes, and cinematics using simple macros.

The effects are rendered directly into the DOM (HTML), ensuring they appear **above** the UI and are fully synchronized between all players.
